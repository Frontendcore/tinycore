February 12, 2013 - v0.1.1

* Sandbox : solve small naming inconsistencies in the sandbox pub-sub system. We are now using "topics" instead of "events" (thanks to joseprio).
* Sandbox : added an optional context argument to the subscribe method.
* Core : remove deep methods decoration because when subscribing if the handler is a method of an object defined as a property of the module itself the context of execution cannot be set correctly.
