February 13, 2013 - v0.1.1

* Sandbox : solve small naming inconsistencies in the sandbox pub-sub system, we're now using "topics" instead of "events" (thanks to joseprio).
* Sandbox : added an optional context argument to the subscribe method.
* Core : remove deep methods decoration because when subscribing, if the handler is a method of an object defined as a property of the module itself, the context of execution cannot be set correctly.
* Sandbox : subscribers handlers are now also wrapped into a try-catch statement
